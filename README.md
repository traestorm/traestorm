- 👋 Hi, I’m @traestorm.  You can call me Trae.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things including coding, RC vehicles, electronics, video games, and miniature painting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python again.  I furst learned it about 20 years ago but I haven't touched it in 15ish?  I am alos wanting to learn C++ and OOP.  I learned structyured parogramming in the 80's but have been working in Infrastructure in the interviening years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything considering I need to relearn almost everything.  I have an interest in a number of areas.  I would like to learn game programming A.I.  I have always been unstaisfied with enemy responses and pathing in games so that is an area I'd like to explore.  In general, I want to be able to tackle any problem with some degre of confidence.
